## 2. Philosophy

The philosophy behind Fontpub is rooted in the culture of *Libre Fonts*: the belief that typography, as both software and cultural expression, should be accessible, modifiable, and distributable by anyone — not merely for convenience, but to preserve creative freedom.

However, freedom alone is not sufficient. In the digital age, where fonts circulate as downloadable assets, authenticity, integrity, and verifiability are equally essential. A truly open ecosystem must not only allow sharing but also enable participants to prove authorship and trace provenance.

Existing systems typically achieve trust through reputation or centralization. Google Fonts, for example, has been instrumental in democratizing access to type, but its trust model is organizational. Users trust Google as an institution, rather than the individual publishers. This approach scales distribution but weakens the direct link between creator and user. It simplifies consumption while diluting accountability.

Fontpub takes a complementary stance. It does not oppose centralized services like Google Fonts but defines the minimal protocol required for fonts to remain autonomous. Each publisher can declare metadata, sign manifests cryptographically, and prove domain ownership — all without appealing to a central registry. The system operates with the same logic as open web infrastructure: simple, inspectable, and verifiable by anyone.

This shift moves the foundation of trust from institutions to proofs. Instead of believing in a brand, users verify a signature. Instead of a single repository, there can be many *curations* — each offering its own perspective while remaining interoperable under a shared open standard.

Fontpub thus envisions the web of typography as a *network of verifiable publications* — where type designers, foundries, curators, and users participate as equal peers in a decentralized ecosystem. It is not a service but an infrastructure, a shared language that allows independent publication to thrive with the same openness and integrity that define the web itself.
