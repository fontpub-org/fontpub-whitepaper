## 8. Conclusion

Fontpub proposes a minimal yet complete protocol for decentralized, verifiable, and reproducible font distribution on the web. It does not seek to replace existing infrastructures but to redefine their foundations. Where current systems rely on institutional trust, Fontpub establishes cryptographic trust; where authority is centralized, Fontpub distributes it to the edges.

By introducing a simple model based on signed manifests and domain proofs, Fontpub enables fonts to exist as **verifiable publications** — self-contained, cryptographically authentic artifacts that can circulate freely while preserving provenance. It restores agency to type designers, allowing them to publish independently from their own domains, and it empowers users to verify authenticity without intermediaries.

This separation of *trust* from *brand* marks a philosophical turning point. Trust no longer depends on who hosts a font, but on the verifiable proofs that attest to its origin. The infrastructure of typography, like that of software, can now become distributed, auditable, and self-sustaining.

Fontpub stands not as a service, but as a **protocol** — a shared language for type distribution rooted in the principles of the open web: independence, transparency, and verification. It extends the ideals of Libre Fonts into the infrastructural layer, ensuring that openness is not just a cultural aspiration but a technical reality.

In the long view, Fontpub’s success will not be measured by how many fonts it hosts, but by how many publishers no longer need hosting. When verification becomes natural and infrastructure becomes invisible, Fontpub’s purpose will have been fulfilled — the web will have gained not just a protocol for fonts, but a foundation for verifiable digital authorship.
