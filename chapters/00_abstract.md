# Fontpub: A Decentralized Protocol for Verifiable Font Distribution

## Abstract

Fontpub is a decentralized protocol for verifiable font distribution on the web. It defines a minimal standard by which type designers and foundries can self-host their releases, sign them cryptographically, and prove domain ownership — without relying on any centralized registry or authority.

At its core, Fontpub defines the *Manifest* — a signed, self-hosted document that binds a font to its publisher and domain through an open proof of domain ownership. *Curations* build on this layer, referencing and organizing verified manifests across the web to enable decentralized discovery. Clients can verify authenticity directly from these sources — with no reliance on any central service or platform.

Fontpub replaces organizational trust with cryptographic trust. It enables fonts to circulate freely across the web while preserving authenticity, integrity, and reproducibility over time. Rather than a service, Fontpub is a shared language — a foundational layer for an open, verifiable ecosystem of digital typography.
