# Fontpub: A Decentralized Protocol for Verifiable Font Distribution

## Abstract

Fontpub is a decentralized protocol for verifiable font distribution on the web. It defines a minimal standard by which type designers and foundries can self-host their releases, sign them cryptographically, and prove domain ownership — without relying on any centralized registry or authority.

The protocol is composed of four interoperable files — `fontpub.json`, `fontpub-keys.json`, `fontpub-proof.txt`, and `fontpub-curation.json` — which together establish a verifiable relationship between a font, its publisher, and its source domain. Clients can independently install and verify fonts using standard web formats and modern cryptographic primitives (HTTP, JSON, and Ed25519).

Fontpub replaces organizational trust with cryptographic trust. It enables fonts to circulate freely across the web while preserving authenticity, integrity, and reproducibility over time. Rather than a service, Fontpub is a shared language — a foundational layer for an open, verifiable ecosystem of digital typography.
